For this particular question, we shall test you for your knowledge gained in the class of Algorithms
Design and Analysis. Recall we have studied Divide and Conquer technique to work out different
problems of varyying natures. Our problem at hand is to efficiently search an integer value from grid of
size n x n, where n is any integer, using the principles of divide and conquer. But the grid has both it's
rows as well as columns sorted in ascending order (see fig).

# The following must be submitted:

```
a. Full algorithm stepwise.
```
```
b. Code with outputs as well as proper commenting. (Any language will work)
```
```
c. Time complexity of your code with explanation.
```
**Note:** Part a and c to be done in a word file whereas b can be submitted separately as a code file.
